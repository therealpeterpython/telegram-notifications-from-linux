# Telegram Notifications from Linux

A lightweight script for sending Telegram notifications from Linux.
The notify-checker.sh script reads the information and token files and sends the extracted message via telegram-notify.sh to the user. The examples folder contains examples on how to use this script to send notifications from other programming languages. This can be useful to receive a notification when a long-running calculation is complete.

We utilize the great [telegram-notify.sh](https://github.com/NicolasBernaerts/debian-scripts/blob/master/telegram/telegram-notify) to post the messages to Telegram.
